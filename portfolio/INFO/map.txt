An initial map of how the portfolio construction and implementation algorithm will work.

Inputs: An acceptable level of risk in the construction of this portfolio
Feed: Different tickers, from the research engine. Each ticker will be accompanied by two numbers, a strength number
(an indicator of whether research believes it will grow in price), and a risk/volatility number. 


Pseudocode:
A sorting algorithm should take each given ticker, and arrange in a linked list or dynamically allocated array
by strength number; strongest first, weakest last.
